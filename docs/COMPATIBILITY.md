# Compatibility

This repository treats supported Python, MCP SDK, authorization, transport, and pair
interoperability as executable contracts. Package metadata is the public source of truth, while
CI verifies both the support floor and the moving compatible edge.

## Supported contract

| Dimension | Supported policy | CI evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python | `>=3.13,<3.15` | Python 3.13 and 3.14 matrix cells |
| MCP Python SDK | `>=2.0,<3` | `minimum` and `latest` profiles |
| MCP SDK support floor | `2.0.0` | Exact `mcp==2.0.0` installation |
| MCP SDK upper boundary | `<3` | Latest resolver constrained to MCP 2.x |
| MCP protocol reference profile | `2026-07-28` | Versioned pair contract + client-owned E2E |
| Transport | Streamable HTTP | Production and loopback profiles |
| Auth providers | Entra ID, generic OIDC | Provider/transport matrix |
| OAuth extension | client credentials (generic deterministic profile) | Client-owned pair E2E |

All four Python × MCP-profile cells must pass the repository test suite.

## Two different CI guarantees

`quality.yml` remains deterministic: it validates the exact dependency graph recorded in
`uv.lock`. `compatibility.yml` intentionally mutates only the disposable CI virtual environment
after the locked sync:

- `minimum` installs exactly MCP SDK 2.0.0;
- `latest` upgrades MCP to the newest version resolvable by `mcp>=2.0,<3`;
- the lockfile is never rewritten by the compatibility workflow;
- tests run through `.venv/bin/python`, so `uv run` cannot resynchronize MCP back to the lock.

The compatibility workflow runs for pull requests, pushes to `main`, manual dispatches, and
weekly. The scheduled run detects drift caused by newly published compatible MCP 2.x releases.

## Local Python/MCP verification

Support floor:

```bash
uv sync --frozen --all-groups --python 3.13
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python "mcp==2.0.0"
uv pip check
.venv/bin/python scripts/compatibility_contract.py --python 3.13 --mcp-profile minimum
.venv/bin/python -m pytest --no-cov
```

Moving 2.x edge:

```bash
uv sync --frozen --all-groups --python 3.14
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python --upgrade "mcp>=2.0,<3"
uv pip check
.venv/bin/python scripts/compatibility_contract.py --python 3.14 --mcp-profile latest
.venv/bin/python -m pytest --no-cov
```

## Auth-provider and transport matrix

CI exposes six independent network-silent configuration cells:

| Provider | Production HTTPS | Loopback IPv4 HTTP | Loopback IPv6 HTTP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Entra ID | supported | explicit local profile | explicit local profile |
| Generic OIDC | supported | explicit local profile | explicit local profile |

Across the paired repositories, unit tests also prove the negative boundary:

- production remains HTTPS-only;
- local HTTP cannot escape loopback;
- the client requires explicit opt-in for HTTP loopback;
- the client redirect listener remains an IP-literal loopback endpoint;
- the server rejects wildcard Host/Origin allowlists;
- production rejects insecure OIDC loopback configuration;
- generic production metadata/issuer configuration remains HTTPS-only.

Loopback profiles exist for local development and deterministic E2E testing. They are not
production deployment profiles.

Local auth/transport verification:

```bash
python scripts/auth_transport_contract.py --provider entra --transport production-https
python scripts/auth_transport_contract.py --provider generic --transport loopback-ipv4
python scripts/auth_transport_contract.py --provider generic --transport loopback-ipv6
```

## Cross-repository compatibility

Both repositories publish the same canonical contract at
`compatibility/cross-repository.json`. The contract fixes the tested pair baseline for MCP
`2026-07-28`, Streamable HTTP, the generic OIDC OAuth 2.1 reference flow, required scope, and
positive/negative evidence.

The client repository owns the live pair check because it initiates OAuth and MCP requests. Its
E2E workflow compares both contracts and exercises Protected Resource Metadata, authorization
server discovery, the preferred Client ID Metadata Document path, the backwards-compatible DCR
fallback, PKCE S256, resource-bound token exchange, `server/discover`, and `tools/call`, plus
the self-describing request envelope and sessionless Streamable HTTP behavior. It also exercises
fail-closed issuer/audience/expiry/scope, routing-header/envelope mismatch, unsupported protocol
version, and RFC 9207 mismatch cases.

The CIMD profile proves that an advertised `client_id_metadata_document_supported=true` causes the
configured HTTPS metadata URL to become the public client's `client_id`, with no client secret and
no DCR request. The fake authorization server treats the document as pre-validated fixture data;
hosting and authorization-server retrieval of that HTTPS document remain deployment concerns.
DCR is retained only as a backwards-compatible generic-OIDC reference path.

For modern requests, the client sends the negotiated version in both `MCP-Protocol-Version` and
`params._meta`, mirrors the JSON-RPC method in `Mcp-Method`, and mirrors the tool name in
`Mcp-Name`. After bearer admission succeeds, the server delegates envelope validation to the
official MCP SDK: disagreement returns JSON-RPC `-32020`, while a coherent but unsupported version
returns `-32022` with the supported/requested version data. Modern responses do not mint
`Mcp-Session-Id`; any legacy-looking request header is ignored for identity and authorization state.

The pair's progressive-authorization profile keeps `mcp:tools:call` as the initial resource scope
and protects the example MCP `health` operation with `mcp:tools:health`. An under-scoped request is
rejected before tool dispatch with one `403 insufficient_scope` challenge containing the complete
operation requirement. The client reauthorizes with the union of its prior grant and the challenged
scope, then the SDK repeats that undispatched request once. For Entra, both logical names are
qualified with the configured Application ID URI and `health` requires a delegated identity.
The resource server rejects `offline_access` when configured as a required resource scope because
refresh-token consent belongs to the OAuth client and authorization server, not the protected
resource.

The pair also exercises the official optional `io.modelcontextprotocol/oauth-client-credentials` extension
with the SDK support floor. The server advertises the capability and accepts a resource-bound token
issued to a pre-registered generic-OIDC client; the client proves HTTP Basic token-endpoint
authentication, zero browser authorization, zero DCR/CIMD, and non-interactive scope step-up. This
does not claim Entra client-credentials interoperability. Entra app-only authorization uses
`{resource}/.default`, `idtyp=app`, and explicit app-role policies and remains provider-specific.

Local pair verification:

```bash
python scripts/cross_repository_contract.py --peer-root ../mcp-client-auth-template
```

## Authorization implementer report

The public [MCP Authorization Implementer Report](AUTHORIZATION_IMPLEMENTER_REPORT.md) maps the
paired server/client reference against the MCP `2026-07-28` authorization requirements.

It is deliberately evidence-scoped rather than a blanket compliance claim. The report distinguishes
pair E2E evidence, project-owned unit evidence, behavior delegated to the official MCP Python SDK,
deployment profiles that are supported but not live-verified, and normative cases that are not
independently exercised.

The report snapshot is anchored to server `v0.6.2`, client `v0.6.0`, and the MCP specification
snapshot recorded in the document. It is intended as input to the Authorization Interest Group and
the active Tool Scopes Working Group.

## Scope

The published compatibility claims cover the executable Python/MCP SDK, auth/transport, and
cross-repository reference profiles above. Provider-specific live identity-provider
interoperability remains outside this deterministic local E2E contract.
